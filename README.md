# Discord-Installer-Uninstaller
A script to install/unistall discord using the datto platform. Made by Cameron Day, edits and suggestions by Chris Beldsoe
It downloads DiscordSetup.exe from Discord's cdn and installs it on the local user.
This script can be run locally or through the datto platform as a quick job. To use this locally set $env:mode to either "Install" or "Unistall"
- Example: $env:mode = "Install"
